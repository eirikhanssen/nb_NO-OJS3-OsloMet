# nb_NO-OJS3-OsloMet
OJS3 nb_NO (Norsk bokm√•l) locale based on the Norwegian OJS community  effort led by UiO, with our latest fixes

Note: tools/localesort.sh and tools/localesort.xsl are used to sort the locale files. They will not be packed into the tar.gz archive using the provided packaging command.
Also lib/pkp/dtd will not be packed as it is not neccessary. (the OJS installation already has these dtds).

## How to create tar.gz archive and install this locale on top of your ojs installation
### Note: use at own risk

Clone the github repo and move into the folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/eirikhanssen/nb_NO-OJS3-OsloMet.git
cd nb_NO-OJS3-OsloMet
```
1. Create a tar.gz archive with all the local files and 2. (optional) move it out of the git repo (to the parent folder of the git repo).
Change the date timestamp if you wish.
```
1. tar -cvzf nb_NO-OJS3-OsloMet-2018-08-29.tar.gz ./lib ./locale ./plugins --exclude='./lib/pkp/dtd' 
2. mv nb_NO-OJS3-OsloMet-2018-08-29.tar.gz ..
```
Change directory into the OJS3 installation root, the same folder where **config.inc.php is located**
```
cd path/to/ojs3-installation-dir
```
To overwrite the nb_NO locale files with the ones in this package, extract the files to the OJS3 installation root. 
Note: this will overwrite nb_NO locale xml files in **lib**, **locale** and **plugins** sub-folders:
```
tar -xvzf path/to/nb_NO-OJS3-OsloMet-2018-08-29.tar.gz
```
